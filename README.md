- Conceptual overview of RDDs
  - Continuity framework: we can model the relationship between the running variable and outcome using some polynomial function (e.g., pre- and post-test scores).
  - Randomization framework: Close to the cutoff, observations are distributed as-good-as randomly due to measurement error or other stocastic process.
- Coding example
  - Replicating Cody Tuttle's [*Snapping Back: Food Stamp bans and Crimincal Recidivism*](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20170490) (2019). Abstract below.  
    > I estimate the effect of access to food stamps on criminal recidivism. In 1996, a federal welfare reform imposed a lifetime ban from food stamps on convicted drug felons. Florida modified this ban, restricting it to drug traffickers who commit their offense on or after August 23, 1996. I exploit this sharp cutoff in a regression discontinuity design and find that the ban increases recidivism among drug traffickers. The increase is driven by financially motivated crimes, suggesting that the cut in benefits causes ex-convicts to return to crime to make up for the lost transfer income.
